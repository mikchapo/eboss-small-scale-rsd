# eBOSS Small-scale RSD

This project consists of code used to measure small-scale RSD within the eBOSS LRG sample. This work was published in MNRAS (https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/516/1/617/6649829; Chapman et al. 2022) and was written by the lead author, Dr. Michael Chapman.

This code was primarily developed locally and by a single author, which is why it was committed as a finished product here. While the code is generally written to be readable and to comply with PEP 8 and PEP 257, it was developed for a single application that would not require additional programmers to review the code, and with a focus on quickly obtaining the results for pulication, so it is only lightly documented. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (mj3chapm@uwaterloo.ca).
